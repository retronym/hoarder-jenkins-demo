## hoarder-jenkins-demo

Sample project showing how to combine SBT, Jenkins and
[hoarder](https://github.com/romanowski/hoarder) and 
Jenkins' `stash/unstash` (https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#unstash-restore-files-previously-stashed) to reuse compiled classes across different stages of a Jenkins pipeline.

Note that `scalac` is not invoked in the "Test" stage:
